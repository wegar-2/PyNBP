# PyNBP

This simple package provides simple interface that allows you to download the 
data select types of time series made available 
via [National Bank of Poland's API](http://api.nbp.pl/en.html).


The following time series can be downloaded using PyNBP:

1. Average daily FX rates for select currencies 
(cf. [NBP's website]()  for list of currencies for which exchange rates are published).
2. Table of historical central bank interest rates.
3. Gold prices in PLN (note: the gold prices published by NBP are prices of 1g of gold).

Strictly speaking, the table of historical interest is not provided via NBP's API.

I provide code snippets illustrating how to use the package below.
